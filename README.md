# Verilog-codes-for-basic-digital-circuits-DVLSI

This page is for Verilog codes for some basic digital circuits necessary for **academic** as well as **interview** prospective.

---

### In a design.v code, there contain multiple models of Verilog code which are :-
1. Dataflow  
2. Behavioural  
3. Structural  
4. Gatelevel  

---

### While testing we need to keep some points in our mind :-
1. Choose one model and remove the Multi-line comment Block (`/* */`) at first and last of the model block.  
2. Remember the model blocks should be under (`/* */`) since we can choose only 1 model at a time.  
3. While executing all the models, use `output x,y,z` except in case of behavioural model i.e., `output reg x,y,z`. So comment the unused line.  
4. Follow other instructions and syntax if any error occurs.  

Mostly there will be less or no chances of error since the codes are already tested and verified and if used properly with above instructions and Verilog rules and syntaxes.
