This repository contains Verilog codes for basic digital circuits, useful for both **academic learning** and **interview preparation**.

### ðŸ“˜ Verilog Coding Models and Verification
Verilog is a hardware description language (HDL) used to model digital systems. Each circuit in this repository is implemented in multiple coding styles to give a complete understanding of design approaches. Alongside RTL design, **testbench files** are provided for simulation and functional verification. This ensures that each circuit is tested, verified, and ready for practical usage in labs and projects.  

The `design.v` files contain the main circuit, while the `tb.v` files are testbenches used to verify the correctness of the design.  

The coding models covered are:  
1. **Dataflow** â€“ Describes the circuit in terms of Boolean expressions.  
2. **Behavioral** â€“ Uses high-level constructs (always blocks, if-else, case) to model behavior.  
3. **Structural** â€“ Describes the design by interconnecting submodules or components.  
4. **Gate-level** â€“ Implements the design using primitive logic gates.

### âœ… Notes for Testing:
1. Choose one model and remove the multi-line comment block (`/* */`) around it.  
2. Keep all other model blocks under (`/* */`) since only one model can be active at a time.  
3. In sequential circuit codes, both **Structural** and **Behavioral** models are provided. In the testbench, comment out the one you donâ€™t want to use. (*Behavioral model is generally preferred for sequential circuits.*)  
4. While executing all models, use `output x,y,z` except in the Behavioral model where `output reg x,y,z` must be used. Comment out unused lines accordingly.  
5. Follow Verilog syntax rules and the given instructions; errors are rare since the codes are tested and verified.
