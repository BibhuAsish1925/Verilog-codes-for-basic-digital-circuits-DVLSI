This repository contains Verilog codes for basic digital circuits, useful for both **academic learning** and **interview preparation**.

---

### In a `design.v` file, each circuit contains multiple coding models:
1. Dataflow  
2. Behavioral  
3. Structural  
4. Gate-level  

---

### âœ… Notes for Testing:
1. Choose one model and remove the multi-line comment block (`/* */`) around it.  
2. Keep all other model blocks under (`/* */`) since only one model can be active at a time.  
3. While executing all models, use `output x,y,z` except in the behavioral model where you must use `output reg x,y,z`. Comment out unused lines accordingly.  
4. Follow Verilog syntax rules and instructions; errors are rare since the codes are tested and verified.
